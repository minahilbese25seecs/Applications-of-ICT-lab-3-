this repo contains the code for calculator made either in assembly or in python with its respective outputs.

PYTHON REFLECTIONS:

Q) Why is Python easier/faster for building the same project? Python is easier in the sense of building the project.
A) 1-The syntax of Python is easier to work with. 
2-Python is a high-level language, whereas assembly is a low-level language, so writing code in Python is easier for human beings. 
3- Python is user friendly:  Even for a simple output or function in the assembly, we have to write a large code, whereas it is not the case in python.

Q) Which features of Python help with abstraction (variables, functions, loops)?                                              A) Variables: Variables are very easy to use in Python, as we can declare them later on and can even change them. Secondly, we can use it without declaring types.                                                                                    Functions: Python helps with functions as they are reusable and help keep the code organised.                                 Loops: Loops in Python are handy to repeat the actions and check them again and again. In Python, the syntax for loop is simple and concise, which makes it user friendly.


ASSEMBLY REFLECTIONS:

Q) What did you notice about registers and instructions?
A) The thing that i noticed about registers and instructions in assembly is that registers act as storage for the user to store the data like ebx,eax etc. On the other hand, instructions are the code that a coder writes to tell the complier about what should be done with the stored data(storage done by registers) that includes MOV,ADD,SUB etc.

Q) How is coding in Assembly different from Python?
A) Coding in assembly is different from python in many aspects.For example, in assembly we use registers like eax to store our required data to use it later whereas in python,the coding is straightforward and very user-friendly for beginners who wish to learn coding. 

COMPARISON TABLE:

| Feature | Assembly Example | Python Example | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Variable storage** | Register (EAX) | `x = 5` | Assembly stores data in registers                                                                                             such as EAX, whereas Python uses named                                                                                        variables as containers. |
| **Printing output** | `INT 21h` | `print()` |  assembly requires a directive like INT 21h to                                                                                 collaborate with the operating system for                                                                                     output. In Python, we use the print()                                                                                         function for output. |
| **Arithmetic** | `ADD AX, BX` | `x + y` | Assembly uses short forms like (ADD) to                                                                                       perform that operation directly. In python,                                                                                   we use the operation on a constant or a                                                                                       variable by instructing the compiler.|
